        <h2>about jableh</h2>
        <p>Jableh has been inhabited since at least the second millennium BCE. The city was part of the Ugaritic kingdom and was mentioned as "Gbʿly" in the archives of the city c. 1200 BC.In antiquity Jableh (then called Gabala) was an important Hellenistic and then Roman city. One of the main remains of this period is a theatre, capable of housing c. 7,000 spectators. In the medieval period, Jableh, then called Gibellum, was conquered by Christian crusaders on 23 July 1109 and was part of a Crusader State until it was captured by Saladin in 1189 during the Third Crusade.</p>
